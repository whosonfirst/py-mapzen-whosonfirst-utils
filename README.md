# py-mapzen-whosonfirst-utils

## IMPORTANT

This library is provided as-is, right now. It lacks proper
documentation which will probably make it hard for you to use unless
you are willing to poke and around and investigate things on your
own.

## Installation

The usual Python dance:

    sudo python setup.py install
    

## Usage

The good stuff is in the `scripts` directory.

For example:

    wof-placetype-to-csv -s ../../whosonfirst-data/data/ -c ../../whosonfirst-data/meta/ -l -v
